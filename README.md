# Barstool Boxscore Challenge - React
### Completed by: Sam Hamburger
This React application consists of two primary components, the Scoreboard and the MiniScoreboard. Both components fetch data from the [Barstool Boxscore Challenge - NodeJS Server](https://github.com/sh786/bs_score_api) running locally. To start the react app, run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```

This react application runs on http://localhost:3000 and was scaffolded using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This code was developed for the [Barstool Boxscore Challenge](https://github.com/BarstoolSports/fullstack-challenge).
